This activity should be entered on the tap of publish data 
the display page should display all the activated sensors
The activated sensors should be displayed as a rows with a checkbox associated with them
These rows must be scrollable (scroll view for row layout). 
At the end of the scrollable pane There should be a two /(similar to running and disable) button which says start/stop(streaming)

Approach 2:
Since publish has no ui effect the best way to use the publish data to server is service 
The service is called with the vs name after every flick enabled of the vs on the show vs page
---- on the list vs page user selects the mode to running
---- An instance of service is started with the vs name and the services queries the data and publishes it to the server
---- On the flick of another vs to running the another instance of service is created and the vs name is provided to this instance of the service
